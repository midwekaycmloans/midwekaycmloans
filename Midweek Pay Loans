Midweek Pay Loans

Small installment loans with unreasonably long durations can result in extremely high costs because only a small proportion of each payment reduces the principal; the rest goes toward interest and fees. For instance, a $300 loan with an 18-month term can result in a total repayment of nearly $1,800â€”or roughly six times the amount borrowed. To ensure that the repayment period is not excessive, lawmakers should limit total loan charges to half of the amount borrowed. Thus, the maximum charge on a $300 loan would be $150. This would ensure that lenders not reap additional fees by setting unnecessarily long terms. Ohio lawmakers limited total loan costs to 60 percent of the amount borrowed.
