State lawmakers need to be on the alert: Big changes are underway in the payday loan market, many of which will be detrimental to borrowers and socially responsible lenders. Longer-term, high-cost payday and auto title installment loans have spread dramatically as companies diversify their business models in an attempt to reduce reliance on conventional payday loans. However, without state-level safeguards, these longer-term products often have excessive prices, unaffordable payments, and unreasonably short or long durations, and therefore can be as harmful to borrowers as conventional payday loans.
